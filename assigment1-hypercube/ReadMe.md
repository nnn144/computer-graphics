**In this assignment, an animation of a spinning hypercube is created**. The animation should be similar to the one shown in the figure below. The hypercube is shown as a wire-frame object (i.e., vertices connected by lines).

**In this animation, the inner cube will increase and decrease in size (i.e., scaling) as the whole structure spins.** The hypercube in Figure 1 appears to rotate around a circular path. In your animation, you can simplify the spinning motion by fixing the rotation axis.

** This assignment is based on the Basic geometric transformations in 2-D and 3-D.** The materials are also in this directory: 2D and 3D transformation.
